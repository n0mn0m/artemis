# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Contributions can be bug reports, feature requests, testing and documentation
in addition to code.

Contributions to this project are accepted on an
["inbound=outbound"](https://opensource.com/law/11/7/trouble-harmony-part-1) basis.
That means that you agree that your contributions are made under the
same license as the license for this project (found in this directory in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file).

To make this understanding explicit -- and for you to assert
that you have the right to make the contribution -- commits must be
signed off indicating acceptance of the
[Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/).
A nice explanation of the DCO has been provided by
[Karl Fogel](https://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/)
in his excellent book [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/en/contributor-agreements.html#developer-certificate-of-origin).
An explanation of the "sign-off" procedure is given by
[Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst#11-sign-your-work---the-developers-certificate-of-origin).

## Contribution Workflow

This is an overview of the contribution workflow:

 * Clone the repo
 * Create a branch
 * Make your change
   * Make commits to your branch using the following guidelines:
     * Start with a subject line (beginning with a capital, ending without a period, no more than 50 characters)
     * The second line should be blank
     * The body starts on the third line
     * Use the imperative mood in the subject line: "Add x", "Fix y", "Support z", "Remove x"
     * Wrap the body at 72 characters
     * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
     * Finish the commit message with the sign off: `Signed-off-by: Your Name <me@e.mail>`
 * Test
 * If applicable make sure formatting rules are applied
 * [Email](https://www.devroom.io/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/) a [patchset](https://www.devroom.io/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/)
